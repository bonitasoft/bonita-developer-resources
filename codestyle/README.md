## Eclipse IDE configuration

Predefined configurations for formatter and templates to install in Eclipse IDE.

### Clean Up

* Go to `Preferences` > `Java` > `Code Style` > `Clean Up` panel
* Click on _Import..._
* Select [cleanUp.xml](cleanUp.xml)
* Set _BOS-CleanUp_ as Active profile

### Code Templates

* Go to `Preferences` > `Java` > `Code Style` > `Code Templates` panel
* Click on _Import..._
* Select [codetemplates-community.xml](codetemplates-community.xml) or [codetemplates-subsciption.xml](codetemplates-subsciption.xml)

### Formatter

* Go to `Preferences` > `Java` > `Code Style` > `Formatter` panel
* Click on _Import..._

## IntelliJ IDEA configuration

### Formatter

Install the `Eclipse Code Formatter` plugin.  
Then in the plugin settings, configure as in the following:

![intellij formatter](doc/intellij_formatter.png)

### Imports

In the `Code Style > Java` settings, configure as in the following:

![intellij imports](doc/intellij_imports.png)


In order to auto organize imports on the fly, go to `Editor > General > Auto import` and check all options:

![intellij auto import](doc/intellij_auto_import.png)


### Copyright headers

With Intellij it's possible to define different headers for community and subscription code.  
In the Scopes settings
* create a scope named `Community`
* in the `Pattern` field enter `org.bonitasoft..*`
* check the box "Share scope" 

Repeat the operation to create the `Subscription` scope. Use the pattern `com.bonitasoft..*`

You should have something like in the following:

![intellij imports](doc/intellij_scopes.png)


The, create two new profiles using the `Copyright > Copyright Profiles`
